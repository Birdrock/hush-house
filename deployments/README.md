## Deployments

Here's where you can find all of the deployments that are picked up by `hush-house` to deploy in the `hush-house` cluster.

Each deployment directory is meant to be a [Helm Chart](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md), supposed to be continuously deployed in the form of releases.

For more information about each deployment, jump to the corresponding directory's README (for instance: [metrics' deployment README](./metrics/README.md)).
